Games Decription Ideas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backrooms -
You play as a researcher working for a secret organization known as the Foundation, whose mission is to explore, document, and contain anomalous entities, objects, and locations. After a routine exploration mission goes wrong, you find yourself trapped in The Backrooms, an infinite, labyrinthine like structure filled with unsettling entities and unknown dangers. Your goal is to escape while enountering and documenting creatures. Along the way, you’ll pass other lost agents, rogue SCPs (enemies), and powerful entities, all while uncovering hidden truths about the Backrooms and its connection to the Foundation.

Features/Ideas:
- Inventory Size should be a minimum of 7.
- More Items in inventory, slower player is.
- Player could pick backpack up which would increase inventory size.
- if doorway is boarded up you can use crowbar to pry.
